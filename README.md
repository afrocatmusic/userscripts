# afro's userscripts

Before you install any of these [YSK](## "You Should Know"): I have basically no idea what i'm doing. I don't know how to code anything and these scripts came together after extensive googling and asking questions to people on discord.  
That being said, these scripts work fine for me, I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) to test them.  
I'm also very new to github :D  

## [MBz Youtube Music Lookup](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/MBz-YouTube-Music-Lookup.user.js)  
Adds a button to any [MB](## "MusicBrainz") release page. Pressing the button opens a new [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) tab and searches for the artist and title of that release page.

## [Harmony Youtube Music Lookup](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/Harmony-YouTube-Music-Lookup.user.js)  
Adds a "Youtube Music Lookup" link to any [Harmony](https://harmony.pulsewidth.org.uk/) release page with search parameters of the currently loaded release.

## [MBz Blur NSFW cover art](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/MBz-Blur-NSFW-cover-art.user.js)  
Blurs [NSFW](## "Not Safe For Work") cover art on [MB](## "MusicBrainz") if it's tagged appropriately. Works on release and release group pages.
