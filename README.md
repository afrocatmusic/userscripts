# afro's userscripts

Before you install any of these you should know: I have basically no idea what i'm doing. I don't know how to code anything and these scripts came together after extensive googling and asking questions to people on discord.  
That being said, these scripts work fine for me, I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) to test them.  
I'm also very new to github :D  

## [MBz Youtube Music Lookup](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/MBz-YouTube-Music-Lookup.user.js)  
Adds a button to any MusicBrainz release page. Pressing the button opens a new [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) tab and searches for the barcode of that release.
If the release has no barcode, it will search for the artist and title of that release.

## [Harmony Youtube Music Lookup (deprecated)](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/Harmony-YouTube-Music-Lookup.user.js)  
Adds a "Youtube Music Lookup" link to any [Harmony](https://harmony.pulsewidth.org.uk/) release page with search parameters of the currently loaded release.  
[afro's Harmony Add-Ons](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/afros-Harmony-Add-Ons.user.js) includes a better YouTube Music search, plus other services and some other handy tools for Harmony.

## [MBz Blur NSFW cover art](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/MBz-Blur-NSFW-cover-art.user.js)  
Blurs NSFW cover art on MusicBrainz if it's tagged appropriately. Works on release and release group pages.

## [RYM Search release in MusicBrainz](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/RYM-Search-release-in-MusicBrainz.user.js)
Adds a link to [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/) release pages to search the current release in MusicBrainz.

## [MBz Copy URLs](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/MBz-Copy-URLs.user.js)
Adds a button to MusicBrainz releases to copy all URL relationships to the clipboard. It also enables copying barcodes in one click.

## [afro's RG Search Utilities](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/afros-RG-Search-Utilities.user.js)
Adds buttons to find the current release group in RateYourMusic, Genius, Wikidata, and AllMusic.

## [afro's Beatsource Add-Ons](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/afros-Beatsource-Add-Ons.user.js)
Adds some extra info to Beatsource release pages and some handy links to help import releases to MusicBrainz.

## [afro's Harmony Add-Ons](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/afros-Harmony-Add-Ons.user.js)
Adds extra lookup options and various "copy to clipboard" functions to Harmony's release pages.  
I recommend using this script instead of [Harmony Youtube Music Lookup](https://github.com/afrocatmusic/userscripts/blob/main/Harmony-YouTube-Music-Lookup.user.js), or at least not both at once.
